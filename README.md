# OpenEgyptology.org

This is the core repository of [OpenEgyptology.org](https://openegyptology.org), committed to democratizing the study of ancient Egyptian history, architecture, and culture. Our mission is to eliminate barriers to high-quality research and data by providing a centralized repository of freely accessible resources.

## Our Mission
1. **Archive:** Collect and preserve diverse datasets on ancient Egypt, ranging from images to 3D models.
2. **Share:** Make this data publicly accessible with minimal restrictions.
3. **Educate:** Provide an engaging platform to visualize and explore data through 3D visualizations and interactive research tools.
4. **Collaborate:** Create an inclusive community where enthusiasts, researchers, and scholars can collaborate openly.

**Note:** This project heavily relies on independent research while upholding rigorous scientific standards. We explicitly distance ourselves from unscientific theories and conspiracy-driven narratives.
